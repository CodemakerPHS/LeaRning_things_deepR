# Intermediate R {.tabset}

<!-- This version basically is feature-creeping itself to death. Might well be better as fully modular - one on functions, one on iteration, one on dplyr, one on purrr -->

```{r pre-setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=F}
install.packages(setdiff("pacman", rownames(installed.packages())))
library("pacman")
p_load(tidyr,readr,DiagrammeR,ggplot2,dplyr,lubridate,NHSRplotthedots,readxl,stringr,NHSRdatasets, purrr)

# avoiding tidyverse due to memory issues in RStudio Cloud environment 
```

## Introduction

This is an introduction to programming in R.

Expects you to have basic familiarity with R and Rmarkdown, including Tidyverse. While the expectations are fairly low - you absolutely don't need to be an R expert - you should have some experience using R before enrolling in this training. It also has a tidyverse flavour, so you should be familiar with using those packages (dplyr especially) if most of your experience has been with base R.

Some self-assessment questions might be useful to calibrate these expectations. Are you able to answer these questions fairly rapidly and with confidence?

- what's a tibble?
- what function would you use to load a csv file?
- how would you make a new column in a tibble from some other column(s)?
- how would you draw a simple graph using `ggplot()`?

If you were able to answer these fluently, then great, this training is meant for you. If they were a bit beyond your previous experience, then you might like to enroll on the KIND Learning Network training *Dynamic Reports in R/Rmarkdown* as a first step.

## What this training will cover

This is a modular training course split into four 90 minute sections. 

- getting the best out of `dplyr` using `NHSRdatasets` as a model system for real-world analysis in R
- tidyselect
- functions, including data indirection for tidyverse functions
- iteration, including using iteration to generate Rmarkdown
- the `purrr` package

You can take any combination of the sessions in any order. They were written together, so there's very little overlap between them.
