## for loops
Can you make a for loop that counts from 1 to 10, and saves those counts in a vector called `word`?

```{r results='asis'}
# write your code below
```

Can you now reverse the order, so that `word` contains 10,9,8...?

```{r results='asis'}
# write your code below
```

Finally, can you use the `glue()` function so that this function prints "10 green bottles, 9 green bottles..."?

```{r results='asis'}
# write your code below
```


## microbenchmark/vectorising
This exercise gives you a chance to practice using `microbenchmark()`, and reminds you of the three ways of vectorising a function. Let's begin with a scalar function:

```{r}
odd_chr <- function(string){
  if(nchar(string) %% 2 != 0) {
    "Odd"
  } else {
    "Even"
  }
}

odd_chr("Thing")
odd_chr("Things")

gazelles <- c("Gazella dorcas", "Gazella subgutturosa", "Gazella bennettii", "Gazella cuvieri", "Gazella gazella", "Gazella leptoceros", "Gazella saudiya", "Gazella spekei", "Gazella erlangeri", "Gazella arabica", "Gazella dorcas x leptoceros", "Gazella sp.")

try(odd_chr(gazelles))
```
Now try using `Vectorize()` to create a new function, `odd_chr_v()` that is vectorised:

```{r}
# write your code below
```

Next, re-write the function to use `ifelse()` rather than an `if()` / `else()`. Call your new function `odd_chr_r()`:

```{r}
# write your code below
```


Finally, write a loop to iterate over `gazelles` using `odd_chr()`:

```{r}
# write your code below
```
Now you should have three pieces of code to evaluate. We can now write a skeleton `microbenchmark()`. Add a `microbenchmark()`, add three sections with some placeholder code like `a = sum(1:1000)`, asign the output to a suitable variable name (like `mbm`). Finally, `autoplot()` your variable name to show the violin plot of execution time:

```{r}
# write your code below
```

(note that you may get odd results if you use extremely simple code as your placeholder because microbenchmark struggles to be accurate with the really quick stuff)

Once you've got your simple `microbenchmark()` running, you can substitute in the three vectorised versions of `odd_chr()` from above:

```{r}
# write your code below
```

## while loops

Can you use a `while` loop to produce the full lyrics of 10 green bottles? Bonus points if you can update the final iteration to `r link("fit the lyric 'no green bottles'", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Green_Bottles")`:

```{r results='asis'}
# write your code below
```

## Rmarkdown with loops

We're going to update the example in this exercise. We want to make the following changes:

+ instead of a random sample of org_codes, we want to look at all the orgs where attendances is greater than 800000
+ ...and let's rank our orgs in terms of their total attendances, and use that ranking as the sequence for our loop
+ We'll also display rankings in the explanatory text
+ instead of plotting the total attendance on a histogram, we want to look at the three types of attendance separately
+ we want to be a bit more ambitious with our table. Can we update the table so that we get a percentage rate for each of the types of admission?

This is a bit like assembling a jigsaw. The working code 'pieces' are already in the chunk below, and we'll work through assembling them into a working loop.

```{r fig.height=1.5, fig.width=4, results='asis'}
orgs <- ae_attendances %>%
  group_by(org_code) %>%
  summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
  filter(attendances > 800000) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(attendances))) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  pull(org_code)

one_org <- ae_attendances %>%
      group_by(org_code, type) %>%
      summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
      filter(org_code == "RAS")

one_org %>%
  mutate(attendances = glue("{attendances} ({100*(round(attendances / sum(attendances), 3))}% of total)")) %>%
  knitr::kable()

ae_attendances %>%
      group_by(org_code, type) %>%
      summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_histogram(aes(x=attendances, fill=type), bins=10) +
      geom_vline(data = one_org, aes(xintercept=attendances), color=c("#000099")) +
      facet_wrap(~type) +
      xlab("Total admissions") +
      ylab("n orgs") +
      theme(legend.position="none", axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```

```{r fig.height=1.5, fig.width=4, results='asis'}
# write your code below
```
