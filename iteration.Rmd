# Iteration {.tabset}
Norm against using loops in R. Two reasons: performance, and vectorised functions

Imperative programming (for loops) has a place - even if a purist might avoid them. Computer time is usually cheaper than analyst time - and loops definitely have some strengths in real-world analysis, particularly when you need to repeatedly apply a non-vectorised functions - like some of the core Rmarkdown functions. And we'll cover some important tips for avoiding the worst of the performance hit that iteration can cause to your work.

This training session is part of a wider training programme designed as next steps for R users who have moved beyond introductory training. This programme covers:

+ tidy evaluation
+ functions
+ dplyr
+ purr

This iteration training can be taken as a stand-alone session, or integrated into a more involved programme with the other sessions. You can find further details on the [TURAS page](), join the [KIND Learning Network](https://forms.office.com/r/WQdd6HSCEW) for social learning support, or contact [Brendan Clarke](mailto: brendan.clarke2@nhs.scot?subject=[purrr training]) with any queries, comments, or suggestions.

## Introduction

This follows the explanations and code from [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#for-loops).

Note most of this uses base R rather than the tidyverse. This might introduce a bit of unfamiliar code, but we'll explain anything new that crops up, and most of the base R code is pretty straightforward. A couple of examples right away. For some tibble called `df`:

+ `df[[]]`
  + `df[["val"]]` selects the column named `val` 
  + `df[[n]]` selects the nth column from df
+ `df$`
  + `df$val` selects the column named `val` 
  + `df$n` selects the nth column from df

`setdiff()` is very helpful to check what you're selecting:

```{r}
setdiff(synthetic_news_data[["age"]], synthetic_news_data[[2]])

setdiff(synthetic_news_data %>% select(age) %>% pull(), synthetic_news_data[[2]])
```

## For-loops

Let's begin with a simple example:

```{r}

word <- ""

x <- 1:10

for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  word[[i]] <- "iteration is"
}

cat(word)
```

From the [R4DS chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) which - like the rest of that book - is essential reading, we can identify three parts to this for loop:

1. **Output** - what do you want out of the loop? Here, it's `word`, which is initially empty, but will gradually expand...
2. **Sequence** - what do you want to loop over? Here, it's `x`, which contains the numbers 1 to 10
3. **Body** - what do you want the loop to do? Writing the code is easier than explaining it, but the parts here are:
    + first, we have `for()` which starts the loop
    + next, inside the `for()` function, we take the first value of `x`, and store it in `i`
    + we then add the phrase "iteration is" into the `i`th position of the `word` vector
    + finally, we replace the current value of `i` with the next item in the sequence `x`, and re-run the code above. This goes on until we reach the end of the sequence `x`
    
This might be a bit more obvious if we tweak our code to include the value of `i` before each element we add into the `word` vector:
  
```{r}

word <- ""

x <- 1:10

for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  word[[i]] <- glue("iteration {i}")
}

cat(word)
```

And there's no reason we need to confine the output of our loop to a vector. We could adapt our loop to produce a simple tibble:

```{r}

words <- tibble(iteration="",contents="")

x <- 1:5
for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  words[i, 1] <- as.character(i)
  words[i, 2] <- glue("iteration {i}")
}
words %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Exercise

```{r}
#tweak a loop
```

```{r}
#write your own loop
```

## Output

## Sequences

```{r}

# basic sequences
c(1,2,3,4)
1:10

# couple of useful built-in sequences
letters 
LETTERS
month.abb

# sequences from tibbles
# base R
sort(unique(ae_attendances$org_code))

colnames(ae_attendances)

#tidyverse
ae_attendances %>%
  distinct(org_code) %>%
  pull() %>%
  sort()

# couple of helper functions for working through sequences
seq_along(synthetic_news_data) # cycles through the sequence by number
names(synthetic_news_data) # cycles through the sequence by column name (tibbles / data frames only)

# seq_along() also works with vectors etc
seq_along(letters)

# best to avoid rownames if at all possible, but there is also rownames(). May be needed if working with odd, transposed, data
t(synthetic_news_data) %>%
  rownames()

```

## Body

## Vectorised functions

We should try and use vectorised functions

```{r}
perd <- function(x) {
  glue("This value here is {x}")
}

synthetic_news_data %>%
  mutate(age = perd(age))

synthetic_news_data %>%
mutate(age = glue("This value here is {age}"))

```

Those give identical results - inspect code, not much inside `perd()`.

What happens when we try to use this function across everything?

```{r}
synthetic_news_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), perd))
```

That works straightforwardly enough. Things get a bit more complicated when we try to add extra arguments to `perd()` though:

```{r}
perd_v <- function(var_name, x) {
  glue("This value of {var_name} here is {x}")
}
```

We can use dplyr's [context dependent expressions](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/context.html) here

```{r}
synthetic_news_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ perd_v(cur_column(),.)))
```

But, particularly as a beginner, this kind of syntax is hard to write and understand. A simpler option is to use a loop to do this reworking;

```{r}
output <- synthetic_news_data
x <- names(output)

for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  output[[i]] <- perd_v(names(output[i]), output[[i]])
}
glimpse(output[1,])

```

## Rmarkdown with loops {.tabset}

### Introduction

One area where loops excel is generating a mixture of R and Rmarkdown. We'll demonstrate an example of this in the next subsection. This loop uses the attendances data from the `ae_attendances` dataset, which looks like this:

```{r}
ae_attendances %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

The aim here is to demonstrate how to write a loop that performs the same bit of analysis for each of the orgs in the data, and inserts that bit of analysis for one org into a separate Rmarkdown subsection. This is a great way of standardising and organising your report - we write the code once only, and then use the loop to run it over different values of org_code. In a bit more detail, our loop will:

+ set up a sequence composed of each of the org_codes in the data
  + actually, I will cheat here. There are 274 orgs in the dataset, and so we'll just look at a random sample of 10 to avoid making a document that takes an eternity to knit.
+ we'll then loop over that sequence, and for each org code it will:
  + print an Rmarkdown header in a new subsection tab
  + print a little bit of explanatory text
  + print a table summarising the admissions data for that organisation
  + display a small graph, showing how the total admissions for that organisation compares with the other 273 orgs in the data

Let's look at the example first, with no code, and then we'll work through each of the stages above to explain how all of the parts fit together.

### Example {.tabset}
```{r loop-ex, echo=F, fig.height=1.5, fig.width=4, results='asis'}
# worth looking at the chunk headers for the example and explanation. We don't repeat the code in this section, but we just re-use the example chunk with different chunk options to show the code rather than the output. https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/reuse-chunks.html is a good place to start if this is of interest.

# note that our loop just displays things in our document, so we don't bother to create an output here

# create a vector of sample orgs to simplify the for() call and filter() indirection later on
orgs_seq <- as.character(sample(ae_attendances %>% 
                                  distinct(org_code) %>% 
                                  arrange(org_code) %>% 
                                  pull(), 10)
                         ) 

# print a single header message outside the body of the loop telling the reader what to expect
cat(glue("In this section we present a summary of admissions data, grouped by type of admission, for a sample of {length(orgs_seq)} organisations.  \n")) 

# set up the main body of the loop
for (i in seq_along(orgs_seq)) {
  
    # calculating the total admissions for our org - we use this in the explanatory text, and in the graph
    org_total_admissions <- ae_attendances %>%
            filter(org_code == orgs_seq[i]) %>%
            summarise(sum(attendances)) %>%
            pull()
    
    # customised 4th level header containing org_code
    cat(paste0("  \n  \n#### ", orgs_seq[i], " attendances  \n"))
    
    # customised explanatory text
    cat(paste0("Some explanatory text: ", orgs_seq[i], " had a total of ", org_total_admissions, " admissions.  \n"))
    
    # use kable() to display a summary of the data
    print(ae_attendances %>%
      drop_na(org_code) %>%
      filter(org_code == orgs_seq[i]) %>%
      group_by(type) %>%
      summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
      knitr::kable()
      )
    
    cat("  \n") # otherwise the graph won't print - see https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/886
    
    # histogram of admissions across orgs, for comparison
    print(ae_attendances %>%
      group_by(org_code) %>%
      summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_histogram(aes(x=attendances), bins=10) +
      geom_vline(xintercept=org_total_admissions) +
      xlab("Total admissions") +
      ylab("n orgs") +
      geom_label(aes(x=org_total_admissions, y=60), label = paste0(org_total_admissions, " total"), nudge_x = 0.35, size = 3)) + # label showing value of admissions for this org
      xlim(0,2000000) #little cheat to keep the label from being cut off for very high values

    cat("\n") # absolutely essential - see https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/886
}

```

### Explanation
```{r, loop-ex, eval=F}
```

### Exercise

We're going to update the example in this exercise. We want to make the following changes:

+ instead of a random sample of org_codes, we want to look at all the orgs where attendances is greater than 800000
+ ...and let's rank our orgs in terms of their total attendances, and use that ranking as the sequence for our loop
+ We'll also display rankings in the explanatory text
+ instead of plotting the total attendance on a histogram, we want to look at the three types of attendance separately
+ we want to be a bit more ambitious with our table. Can we update the table so that we get a percentage rate for each of the types of admission?

Jigsaw puzzle - working code snippets below. We'll work through assembling them into a working loop.


```{r fig.height=1.5, fig.width=4, results='asis'}
orgs <- ae_attendances %>%
  group_by(org_code) %>%
  summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
  filter(attendances > 800000) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(attendances))) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  pull(org_code)

one_org <- ae_attendances %>%
      group_by(org_code, type) %>%
      summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
      filter(org_code == "RAS")

one_org %>%
  mutate(attendances = glue("{attendances} ({100*(round(attendances / sum(attendances), 3))}% of total)")) %>%
  knitr::kable()

ae_attendances %>%
      group_by(org_code, type) %>%
      summarise(attendances = sum(attendances)) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_histogram(aes(x=attendances, fill=type), bins=10) +
      geom_vline(data = one_org, aes(xintercept=attendances), color=c("#000099")) +
      facet_wrap(~type) +
      xlab("Total admissions") +
      ylab("n orgs") +
      theme(legend.position="none", axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```
